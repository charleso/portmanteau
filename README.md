> You see it's like a portmanteauâ€”there are two meanings packed up into one word.

An experiment in combining
[Applicative](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Control-Applicative.html#t:Applicative)
and
[Divisible](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/contravariant/docs/Data-Functor-Contravariant-Divisible.html#t:Divisible)
.

It's _not_ a production library, please don't hurt yourself.
